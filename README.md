## Monopoly Board Game in JS

This is the board game Monopoly in JS that I was inspired to build out using prototypical inheritance patterns. I got the idea after a coding interview where I was asked how I would structure this game in an OOP approach.

- Use [HTTP-Server](https://blog.nodejitsu.com/http-server/) to serve the assets for this game.

### To Do:
- Build out Game logic
  * Take actions after a dice is rolled
  * Community Chest/Chance cards

- Build out Player logic
  * Calculations for money transactions
  * Animate movement of player game piece

- Build views for Property Deed Cards
- Various actions regarding rent payments/go to jail/houses-hotels
- Probably way more that I can't think of
